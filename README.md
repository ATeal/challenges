# Oddball Tech Challenge

This is an open-book test, so Google away, but please don't copy your work from pre-existing solutions you may find or ask others to help you complete the exercises. Solutions should be able to be run on a UNIX command line (Linux/Mac).

## Getting Started

What challenge should I be doing?

- Rails Engineers should try [EFIN Calculator](/efin-calculator#efin-calculator)
- Front End Engineers [Address Book](/address-book)
- Devops Engineers [Server Config](/server-config)
- Node Engineers should try [Analytics Server](/analytics-server) or [Link Checker](/link-checker)

## Getting help

If you get stuck, have a question, or want to clarify any aspect of the homework, you can contact members of our development team by emailing the person who sent you the link to the challenge.

## Submitting your completed homework

To submit your homework, zip up the contents of your git repo in a .zip file. Please remove the .git directory `node_modules` directory, and anything else that might identify you. 

If you want to include any comments with your submission, add them to the COMMENTS file. If there's anything important for us to know about how to run your code, please include that information in the COMMENTS file. Feel free to include any other information relevant to your submission in the COMMENTS as well. Then email the person who sent you the challenge with that zip file. 

**Note** If it is too large to be sent via email, please send a link to google drive/dropbox/box.com instead

## Evaluation process

When we receive your homework, we'll assign it a random number, so that our team does not know whose submission they are reviewing. Your homework will be reviewed by at least three senior engineers on our team.
